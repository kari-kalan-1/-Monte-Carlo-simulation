# -Monte-Carlo-simulation
Monte Carlo Simulation to Estimate Pi is a classic example of using random sampling to estimate a value. The method simulates the process of randomly generating points within a square and checks how many fall inside an inscribed circle. The ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points is used to estimate the value of Pi.
